# Facebook Clone

In this project, we’ll be building a Facebook like application. We'll not focus on styling, but in the core functionalities - users, “friending”, posts, and “liking”. We’ll also implement "sign-in with Facebook" functionality with Omniauth. We'll also write some basic set of unit and integration tests to make sure the associations and the main visual elements have been properly made.

## Technologies

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
