# Title
Building Facebook

## Description
In this project, We’ll be building Facebook. We're not focusing in styling, but in the core functionalities - users, profiles, “friending”, posts, news feed, and “liking”. We’ll also implement sign-in with the real Facebook by using Omniauth and Devise. We'll also write some basic set of integration tests to make sure the associations have been properly set up.
